<h1>LAWN TENNIS</h1>
<p align  "justify"><strong>Lawn tennis</strong>  is a <i>grass court sport</i> where players hit a ball over a net to score points. Key elements include court, scoring, matches, and equipment. Players use rackets to hit a felt-covered rubber ball, with the game being played in different formats. Major events like Wimbledon, a prestigious tennis tournament, are held on grass courts.</p>

<h2>COURT</h2>
<p align  "justify"><strong>Lawn tennis</strong> has four primary types of courts: <i>grass courts</i>, <i>clay courts</i>, <i>hard courts</i>, and <i>carpet courts</i>. <strong>Grass courts</strong> are traditional and fast, with a slower bounce and faster ball bounce. They require high maintenance and can become slippery. <strong>Clay courts</strong>, made from crushed stone, brick, or shale, are slower and harder to hit, favoring players with endurance and strategic shot-making. <strong>Hard courts</strong>, made from asphalt or concrete, offer a medium-paced game with a faster ball bounce. They require less maintenance but can be damaged by extreme weather conditions. <strong>Carpet courts</strong>, cushioned and covered with artificial materials, are fast but require good reflexes and strong serving. Each surface affects how players approach the game, with grass favoring quick, aggressive play, clay rewarding endurance and consistency, and hard courts offering a balanced playing field.</p>

<h2>GAMEPLAY TIPS</h2>
<p align  "justify">-Tennis is a demanding sport, and improving your overall performance can be achieved through various tips. These include serving consistently, adjusting serve placement, and focusing on the return of serve. To anticipate the server's direction, read their body language and position, and be aggressive on the return.<br>
<br>
-Footwork and movement are essential for tennis, with keeping the body low and balanced improving stability and reaction time. Practice the split step and recovery to ensure you are in position to handle the next ball.<br>
<br>
-Groundstrokes should focus on consistency over power, using topspin on both forehand and backhand to control the ball and maximize the court's width. Aim for deep, cross-court shots to force your opponent to cover more ground.<br>
<br>
-Net play and volleyballs should involve solid approach shots, using the continental grip for volleys, and staying active at the net. Mental focus is crucial, with staying calm under pressure, visualizing yourself executing your shots, and maintaining a positive mindset.<br>
<br>
-Adjusting to the court surface is also essential, as the ball bounces lower and more on grass courts.
